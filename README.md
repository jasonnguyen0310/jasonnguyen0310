Hello, my name is Jason Nguyen and I am a recent graduate from The University of California - Irvine with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I have a growing fascination for software development, project management, and video game design.

As an experienced software engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the tech industry, I push myself to engage in my soft skills in terms of providing mentorship, establishing roadmaps, and ensuring a productive engineering environment. Much of my work is done in JavaScript, Python, and C++, but I have dedicated my time to learning languages/frameworks such as GoLang, Swift, and React. I have notable experience working with software iteration, agile development, and CI/CD.

My current goals are to expand my engineering portfolio and skillsets. I am ambitious about developing a product that will one day be used by others that share my passion. My dream is to also someday work in the video game industry.

Would love to connect with you! Feel free to contact me via email -
