Hello, my name is Jason Nguyen and I am currently a third-year at The University of California - Irvine majoring in the field of Computer Sciences. I have a growing fascination for technology, software, and product management.

As an experienced software engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry, I push myself to engage in my soft skills in terms of providing mentorship, establishing roadmaps, and ensuring a productive engineering environment. Much of my work is done in Python, C++, and Java, but I have dedicated my time to learning languages such as C, SQL, and BASH. I have a good understanding of software iteration associated with both waterfall and agile development.

My current goals are to expand my engineering portfolio and skillsets. My dream is to someday work in the video game industry. I am ambitious about developing a product that will one day be used by others that share my passion.

Would love to connect with you! Feel free to contact via email -
