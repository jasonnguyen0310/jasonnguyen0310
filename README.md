Hello, my name is Jason Nguyen and I am currently a junior at The University of California - Irvine majoring in the field of Computer Sciences. I have a growing fascination for technology, video game design, and product management.

Background in software development, and testing. Experienced Software Tester with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry.

Much of my work is done in Python, C++, and C, but I have dedicated my time to learning languages such as Java, Javascript, and Bash. I push myself to engage in my soft skills in terms of providing mentorship, establishing roadmaps, and ensuring a productive engineering environment.

My current goals are to expand my engineering portfolio and skillsets. My dream is to someday work in the video game industry. I am ambitious about developing a product that will one day be used by others that share my passion.

Would love to connect with you! Feel free to contact me at - jasonnguyen0310@gmail.com
