An experienced software engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the tech industry and notable experience working with software iteration, agile development, and CI/CD.

My favorite part(s) about being a software engineer are solving complex issues, continuous integration and delivery, and distributed systems. I love it all!

I push myself to engage in my soft skills in terms of providing mentorship, establishing roadmaps, and ensuring a productive engineering environment. Much of my work and experience were done in TypeScript, Python, and C++, but I have dedicated my time to learning frameworks such as GoLang, Swift, and React.

My current goals are to expand my engineering portfolio and skillsets. I am ambitious about developing a product that will one day be used by others that share my passion. My dream is to also someday work in the video game industry.

Would love to connect with you! Feel free to contact me via email:
